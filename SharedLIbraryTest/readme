steps to create you own shared libraries:
1. create object file
gcc -c -Wall -Werror -fpic foo.c
2. create a shared library from object file,give it a name libfoo.so
gcc -shared -o libfoo.so foo.o
3. link with the shared library, don't forget to tell GCC where to find the shared library
gcc -LsharedLibray's directory -Wall -o test main.c -lfoo
4. run binary and the shared library available at run time
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=shared library's directory:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ ./test
